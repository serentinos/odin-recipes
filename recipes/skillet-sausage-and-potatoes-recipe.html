  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1 pound small gold potatoes (such as Potato Inspirations® Honey Gold® potatoes)</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed</li>
    <li>1 (12-ounce) package fully-cooked smoked beef sausage, sliced 1/2-inch thick</li>
    <li>1 red bell pepper, sliced vertically</li>
    <li>1 green bell pepper, sliced vertically</li>
    <li>1 red onion, cut into 1/2-inch chunks</li>
    <li>1 golden delicious apple - peeled, cored, and cut into 1/2-inch cubes</li>
    <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1/2 cup frozen petite peas</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
    <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley (optional)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Place potatoes in a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until fork tender, 10-12 minutes; drain.
    </li>

    <li>
      Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir smoked sausage in skillet until browned on both sides, about 3 minutes. Remove sausage from skillet to a paper towel-lined plate; leave drippings in pan.
    </li>
    
    <li>
      Quarter the potatoes. Cook and stir potatoes, red pepper, green pepper, onion, and apple in the skillet until potatoes are starting to brown, 8 to 10 minutes; add oil as needed. Stir in garlic; cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.
    </li>

    <li>
      Return sausage to the skillet, stir in peas and thyme, and cook until peas are heated through, 3 to 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper; garnish with chopped parsley.
    </li>
  </ol>
